<strong>Lab 4:</strong><strong> Uninformed Search Strategies Continues </strong>

Uninformed strategies use only the information available in the problem definition. Uninformed Search includes the following algorithms:

<ul>

 <li>Breadth First Search (BFS)</li>

 <li>Depth First Search (DFS)</li>

 <li>Uniform Cost Search (UCS)</li>

 <li>Depth Limited Search (DLS)</li>

 <li>Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)</li>

 <li>Bidirectional Search (BS)</li>

</ul>

The aim of this lab experiment is to solve a given problem (during the lab hour) using any selected uninformed search algorithm. The problem and the algorithm(s) are given during the lab hour.
